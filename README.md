Paws & Found is a passion project I have worked on to help people connect with their perfect furry companions while supporting local animal shelters.

The platform allows users to learn about different dog and cat breeds, create an account, and chat with an AI assistant trained to provide valuable pet information and adoption guidance. It is currently set up to view the availability of adoptable pets at shelters in Orange County.

Future enhancements will include the ability to save favorite animals and search for animal shelters by ZIP code, making it even easier for users to find their ideal pets.
